- Tesla sales have grown significantly since 2015, peaking in 2023.
  
- There was a sharp decline in 2024, possibly due to supply chain or demand factors.

- Tesla vehicles have a significantly higher average electric range — over 200 miles.
  
- Competitor (Other) BEVs average around 100 miles.

- Tesla’s average MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price) is close to $70,000.
  
- Other BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles) average around $35,000.
  
- This indicates that Tesla vehicles are positioned in a higher price segment, which aligns with their longer range and possibly other premium features.

## 4. PHEV vs BEV Trends

- Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) Dominate Overall Growth

  - BEVs (in red) have seen a sharp and consistent rise in adoption since around 2015, with a massive peak around 2023—exceeding 50,000 vehicles in that year.

  - This highlights a strong consumer and market shift toward fully electric vehicles.

- PHEVs Show Steady but Modest Growth

  - Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs, in teal) have experienced moderate, steady growth with no major spikes, peaking at under 20,000 vehicles.

  - They have consistently remained below BEVs in popularity.

- Recent Decline (Post-2023)

  - Both BEV and PHEV trends show a sharp decline in 2024.

  - For BEVs, the drop is particularly steep.

  - This may indicate supply chain issues, policy changes, or market saturation.

### Summary: 
- The trend shows a clear market preference for fully electric (BEV) vehicles over plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), especially after 2015. While PHEVs have grown gradually, BEVs surged rapidly, peaking in 2023 before experiencing a sharp decline in 2024.

- Puget Sound Energy is the Leading Utility
  
  - With over 40,000 Tesla vehicles serviced, Puget Sound Energy (PSE) is the dominant utility provider for Tesla owners in Washington.
    
  - This suggests a high concentration of Tesla drivers in areas covered by PSE.

- Other Top Utilities Include:

  - PUD No. 1 of Snohomish County: ~25,000 Teslas

  - City of Seattle (Seattle City Light): ~20,000 Teslas

  - These are major urban and suburban areas, aligning with higher EV adoption rates.

- Smaller Utilities Still Play a Role:

  - Bonneville Power Administration / PUD of Clark County

  - Bonneville Power Administration / Tacoma Power

  - These have much lower Tesla counts, under ~5,000 each, indicating more limited EV presence in those regions.

## Summary: 
  -  Puget Sound Energy, Snohomish PUD, and Seattle City Light are the top utility providers for Tesla vehicles in Washington, supporting the majority of EV infrastructure in the state. This highlights the importance of regional utility partnerships in supporting EV adoption.
